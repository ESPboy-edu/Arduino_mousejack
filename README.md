Arduino Mousejack
-----------------

Arduino Mousejack is a project, based on **uC_mousejeck** by **[insecuritythings](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/uC_mousejack)**, to get [Mousejack](https://www.mousejack.com) attacks into a small embedded device, with the form factor of a key chain.

![Prototype Mousejack Device](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3:small)

Building the device is straight-forward, and the code provides a tool to use Duckyscript to launch automated keystroke injection attacks against Microsoft and Logitech devices.

Construction
------------

Components list:
 - [Arduino UNO](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2771) or another Arduino-compatible board of your choice.
 - [NRF24L01+ module](http://www.icstation.com/22dbm-100mw-nrf24l01ppalna-wireless-transmission-module-p-4677.html) or another compatible device.
 - A 10Î¼F capacitor to help stabilize the voltage for the NRF24 module.
 - Wires to connections.

 The Fritzing diagram below shows the wiring layout used in the prototype design:

 Building
 --------

 To build the software, download and install the [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide).

 Before building the software, be sure to modify the `attack.h` file using the `attack_generator.py` script:

 ```
 Arduino-mousejack $ cd tools
 tools $ ./attack_generator.py ducky.txt
 ```

 In the example above, the ducky.txt file contains our [Duckyscript](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript). The `attack_generator.py` script will "compile" the ducky script into the `attack.h` file, which is included in `main.cpp`. This simplifies the code and makes it more compact.

 Using
 -----

 Once you power the device on, the internal LED connected to pin 13 (called ledpin in the code), will blink two times for each pass over the entire channel range. When it sends an attack, the LED will glow solid.

 If you monitor the serial port using the PlatformIO IDE, you will see the radio information details and a lot of debugging information being printed while scanning and during attack.

 Warning: No interaction is required to initiate an attack.

 Future
 ------

 Our next iteration will feature a micro-Python version using the ESP8266-based Adafruit Huzzah module. This will provide the capability to load new attacks and obtain diagnostic information using your smartphone (via Wifi).

 It's also possible (and fairly easy) to adapt our code to use an OLED display, microSD card, or any other interaction you can think of. Feel free to fork the code and make something cooler.
